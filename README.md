# VRPen2
## Introduction

Link to a simple collaborative WebGL sample: https://ajtuttle.github.io/VRPen2-WebGL-Sample/

VRPen is an internet-networked light-weight Unity package for collaborative drawing. While initially made as a drawing solution for VR software, it has evolved into a generic drawing package for Unity.

## VRPen has many drawing functions
VRPen has a variety of functions and features, including...
- Adding stamps (images)
- Adding text
- Backgrounds
- Undo
- Clear
- Image Exporting
- Color changing
- Line thickness changing
## VRPen takes advantage of both bitmap and vector drawing benefits
VRPen draws by creating custom geometry which then gets captured and rendered down onto a texture. This means that we get benefits of having individual line objects, and also benefits from the output being a simple texture. Some advantages include...
- The ability to have functions like 'undo'
- The ability to have no-latency smoothing on line input
- The ability to output one drawing canvas onto n displays
- The ability to display drawing canvases on non-flat display (3d objects)
- High performance even with drawings that contain many lines and other graphics.
## VRPen is light-weight
VRPen only renders new lines and graphics when it needs to. By not clearing previous drawing data from the render texture, VRPen is able to avoid rendering the entire canvas every frame.
## VRPen is easily networked
VRPen is not separately networked but is simple to integrate with any pre-existing networking solution. VRPen also has an integrated light-weight caching system for users that join late.
## VRpen has generic output
VRPen have both canvases, and displays. Simply put, canvases are the actually drawings, while displays are where the canvases are displayed. VRPen can simply have one canvas for each display, but it can also be setup to have displays that contain more than one canvas, multiple displays that contain the same canvases, or any combination. 
## VRPen has generic input
VRpen comes with the following input devices and is built in such a way that it is easy to add new custom input devices.
- VR Markers
- Mouse
- Touch screen
- Graphics tablets
